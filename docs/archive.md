The Archive Addon enables a special shortcode that can be used on a WordPress page to show the sent newsletter archives.

What's inside
Show a presentation text
Shortcode attributes
Show newsletters sent a specific list
List newsletters generated by Automated Addon
The shortcode to use is in a WordPress page is:

[newsletter_archive /]
On the first page show, the list of sent newsletters appears made of the subject and the sending date. Clicking on a newsletter, it is shown with a heading 2 title (H2) containing the subject and a frame containing the real text. The frame is required since every newsletter is a real and complete HTML page and cannot be embedded directly into the page: the blog style would affect (negatively) its appearance.

Alternatively, you can set it to show the newsletter content on a new browser page, see the addon configuration.

Some page builders and/or themes block does not work correctly with the page-embedded newsletter view. Use the alternative view mode.

By default, listed newsletters are the ones sent (not still sending), not private, and created as regular newsletters. The automatically generated newsletter can be listed as well, for example, the ones generated by the Automated Addon using special shortcode attributes. See below.

Show a presentation text
The newsletter list could require a “presentation” text. It’s possible to add a text over the list including it with the newsletter archive shortcode. For example, if you want to write over the list “This is my newsletter archive…” you can do it in this way (without inner spaces within the shortcodes):

[newsletter_archive]

This is my newsletter archive…

[/newsletter_archive]
The presentation text is then hidden when the single newsletter is shown.

Shortcode attributes
max – the maximum number of newsletters to list
list – an optional filter specifying to show only newsletter sent to the specific list
type – the newsletter type to show (for example the ones by Automated, see below)
show_date – set to “true” to show the date, if not specified the main configuration is used
separator – symbol or text to separate the date from the newsletter title
title – the list title as H2 text
Show newsletters sent a specific list
To show only newsletters sent to a specific list, you can use this shortcode format:

[newsletter_archive list="X" /]
where X is the list number. If the newsletter has been configured with a combination of list filters (all, almost one, exclusions, and so on), it is shown when the specified list number is found on the “matching lists” without considering the type of matching or the negative matching.

List newsletters generated by Automated Addon
To list the newsletters generated by the Automated addon, you need to add a type to the shortcode:

[newsletter_archive type="automated_X"]
where X is the channel ID number which can be found on the Automated main administration page.
